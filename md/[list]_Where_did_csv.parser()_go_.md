# Where did csv.parser() go?

I need record the starting offsets of csv rows in a database for fast seeking later. 
Unfortunately, using any csv.reader() (or DictReader) tries to cache, which means:
```
example_Data = "'data
0123456789ABCDE
1123456789ABCDE
2123456789ABCDE
3123456789ABCDE
...
'''


for line in reader:
    offsets[row] = f.tell() 
```

is not possible. With my example data , offsets are reported as ```[0, 260, 260, 260...]``` they should be ```[0x00, 0x00,0x15, 0x25, ...]``` (sample data is 16 byte rows after a 5 byte header (just for now)) 

I saw in one of PEP-305's references a mention of csv.parser() which won't return a row until parsing is complete. This is ideal since some lines will have quoted text containing commas and new lines.  I don't want to re-write the parser, since later usage will use csvDictReader, so we need to identically parse rows. How can I do that with the Python 2.7 csv module?

Or how can I accomplish this task through other means?

### response

It's not the reader that performs the caching it's iteration over the file:

```
$ python -c 'f = open("tmp.csv")
> for line in f: print f.tell()
> '
73
73
73
73
73
73
```

You can work around that by using the file's readline() method:

```
$ python -c 'f = open("tmp.csv")
for line in iter(f.readline, ""): print f.tell()
'
5
21
37
53
69
73
```

Combined with csv.reader():

```
$ python -c 'import csv; f = open("tmp.csv")
for row in csv.reader(iter(f.readline, "")): print f.tell(), row
'
5 ['data']
21 ['0123456789ABCDE']
37 ['1123456789ABCDE']
53 ['2123456789ABCDE']
69 ['3123456789ABCDE']
73 ['...']
```
