    <h1>Python Inheritance Terminology</h1>
<p><a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2018-January/729897.html">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2018-January/729897.html</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing some writing for an upcoming course on OOP using Python.  </p>
<p>I have been doing OOP programming for many years in many different languages, and I want make sure that I&rsquo;m using the appropriate terminology in Python.  I&rsquo;d like to know if there are &ldquo;official&rdquo; or even standard terms that are used to describe a class that is inherited from, and the class that is doing the inheriting.  From my reading (especially the PSF docs.python.org <a href="http://docs.python.org/">http://docs.python.org/</a>, it looks like the terms would be &ldquo;base class&rdquo; and &ldquo;subclass&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, in books about Python and other languages, I have also seen the terms:</p>
<p>base class &amp; derived class
parent class &amp; child class
superclass &amp; subclass</p>
<p>So, are base class &amp; subclass the proper terms?</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong></p>
<p>Standard (“official”) terms are most likely to be had from the language
reference <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/">http://docs.python.org/3/reference/</a>. I would recommend
the glossary <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html">http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html</a>, but with the
caveat that many flaws have been found in recent years.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; However, in books about Python and other languages, I have also seen the terms:
&gt;
&gt; base class &amp; derived class
&gt; parent class &amp; child class
&gt; superclass &amp; subclass

<p>The only term I take issue with there is “superclass”. In a
multiple-inheritance system, such as provided by Python, the superclass
is <em>not</em> necessarily the base class. See this article from 2011
<a href="https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/">https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/</a>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion you will be correct to use those terms. Which is not to
say that other terms aren&rsquo;t also good.</p>
