    <h1>Single or Double Quotes?</h1>
<p><strong>OP says:</strong></p>
<p>I am asking myself if I should preferably use single or double quotes
for strings?</p>
<p>If I need a single quote in a string I would use double quotes for the
whole string and vice versa. For f-strings I mostly see double
quotes but single quotes would work as well I think.</p>
<p>Is there a recommendation?</p>
<p><strong>ml_news at posteo.de (Manfred Lotz)</strong><hr></p>
<p>Nothing strong. I tend to use double quotes because I have a
background in C (where double quotes are for strings, single quotes
for characters), and double quotes are the recommendation for
docstrings (see PEP 258). If you tend to work a lot with SQL, you
might prefer single quotes. Use whatever makes you happy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say your consistency matters more than which one you choose.</p>
<p>According to a recent observation by Raymond H.</p>
<pre><code>Over time, the #python world has shown increasing preference
for double quotes:  "hello" versus 'hello'.

Perhaps, this is due to the persistent influence of JSON,
PyCharm, Black, and plain English.

In contrast, the interpreter itself prefers single quotes:

&gt;&gt;&gt; "hello"
'hello'
</code></pre>

<p>I think the worst choice is to be haphazard in your usage with a
hodgepodge of single/double quotes.</p>
<p>I personally use habits from my C days:  double-quotes for everything
except single characters for which I use a single-quote:</p>
<p>if &lsquo;e&rsquo; in &ldquo;hello&rdquo;:</p>
<p>as in indicator that I&rsquo;m using it as a single character rather than
as a string.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a firm rule for myself if a string contains
double-quotes.  It doesn&rsquo;t happen often for me in a case where I
couldn&rsquo;t use a triple-quoted string or that I am refering to it as a
single character.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but triple double quotes ==&gt; &ldquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; &lt;== not triple single quotes ==&gt;
&lsquo;&rsquo;&lsquo; &lt;== is what PEP 258 recommends. The description is awkward but
it&rsquo;s still a place where the double-quote character (U+0022 QUOTATION
MARK) is the recommendation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the recommendation, but double and single quotes work just fine, too &ndash; at least for docstrings that fit an one line.</p>
<p><strong>ethan at stoneleaf.us (Ethan Furman)</strong><hr></p>
<p>I am influenced by Perl which I used before. In Perl I used double
quoted strings when I wanted interpolation. Otherwise single quoted
strings. In Rust (or C) it is double quotes for strings and single
quotes for characters. </p>
<p>You may be right. Consistency is a good thing. So, I have to decide for
what I use and be consistent thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>ml_news at posteo.de (Manfred Lotz)</strong><hr></p>
<p>And I, the shell (where single quotes are &ldquo;raw&rdquo; and double quotes allow 
parameter substitution).  So I use single quotes for plain old strings 
and double quotes when I&rsquo;m going to be formatting the string with % 
(therefore, in most logging calls).</p>
<p>Personally I find double quotes visually noisy, and prefer single 
quotes. Most of the time.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I autoformat with yapf (which doesn&rsquo;t change 
my quoting) rather than black (which is very opinionated and also 
untunable, and <em>does</em> change my quotes).</p>

<p>Personally laziness wins every time. Single quotes only require one
finger from the home position using my right hand, double quotes
require two and a big movement of my left hand from home.</p>
<p>So I use single quotes most of the time (ie unless it contains
a single quote)</p>

<p>I also came to Python from C and tend to make the same mental distinction,
though that has softened with time. Given that I have four different
choices, I consider:</p>
<p>a) If it&rsquo;s preexisting code (especially written by someone else) I try to
maintain that style (if discernable) for consistency, subject to</p>
<p>b) Minimizing the need to use backslashes</p>
<p>I also agree about SQL. I found that something like this:</p>
<pre><code>stmt = (
    """select foo from bar"""
    """  where a = 'bag'"""
    """    and c = 'dog'"""
)
</code></pre>
<p>worked pretty well, served to both satisfy my brain&rsquo;s desire for semantic
indentation (you should see some of the SQL I inherited - yikes!) and
maintain a visual distinction between Python and SQL quoting. (Consistently
using triple quotes minimizes the chance of needing a stray Python
backslash inside the SQL code.) I&rsquo;m now retired, so can&rsquo;t double check, but
I believe SQLite and MSSQL are unusual in their Pythonesque treatment of
single and double quotes being synonymous. I believe most other dialects
(Oracle, MySQL, Sybase, PostgreSQL that I checked) only recognize single
quotes as string delimiters.</p>

<p>From a logical perspective, you are correct.  From the point of view of 
someone who writes more C code than Python, not having to remember a new 
set of habits for Python makes life a lot simpler.</p>

<p>The older (and more professional?) RDBMS accept either/both as variable 
delimiters, per Python strings.</p>
<p>My habit with SQL queries is to separate them from other code, cf the 
usual illustration of having them &lsquo;buried&rsquo; within the code, immediately 
before, or even part of, the query call.</p>
<p>This partly because (a) some dev.teams have a specific person handling 
DBA-tasks, and partly (b) in order to make it easy to 
find/correct/re-factor SQL code without it being mixed-in with the Python.</p>
<p>(a) using a separate and specific module for SQL constants (which may 
include queries as text, or prepared queries), means that the &lsquo;DBA&rsquo; may 
develop independently of the Python devs; that integration of code 
happens in the VCS; that the Python code may separate (stub) or 
integrate during unit-testing, according to progress and choice.</p>
<p>(b) physical &lsquo;extraction&rsquo; and separation make it easier to develop and 
test each component (SQL, Python, &hellip;) separately - either work in SQL 
<em>or</em> in Python, and not have the extra &lsquo;load&rsquo; of having to flip one&rsquo;s 
brain between the two; and by using a separate module, makes it easy to 
locate a &lsquo;class&rsquo; of code dealing with particular data and/or 
carrying-out particular functions - much as you might for classes and/or 
libraries.</p>
<p>Oh, and a further benefit: (further to &ldquo;inherited&rdquo;, above) it becomes 
easier to avoid the massive tangles caused by trying to mix the 
conventions for indenting multi-line SQL code, with those for Python!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m highly amused by this interchange - for two reasons: that you&rsquo;d

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;d noted that the REPL responds with single-quotes, even if I used 
double-quotes in the definition (per &ldquo;single of double&rdquo;, above) - for 
whatever that&rsquo;s worth (it&rsquo;s not as if the delimiters are stored along

<p>That the REPL is &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; about its choice to vary the delimiter to 
suit the content is good (design) sense - the best presentation (UX), ie 
doesn&rsquo;t is a better presentation than doesn't!</p>
<p>Which brings me to my own, humble, and quite often non-PEP-8-respecting 
habits: that I (basically) apply the ?rules of English grammar to Python 
(which I write (mostly) in English). Thus a &ldquo;quotation&rdquo;, eg someone&rsquo;s 
name, but any piece of data, will be enclosed in double-quotes:</p>
<pre><code>name = "Abdur-Rahman"
</code></pre>
<p>whereas, when something will be &lsquo;calculated&rsquo;, I use singles, eg</p>
<pre><code>f'{ name } is top of the class'
</code></pre>
<p>Never learning a language which distinguishes single character literals 
from strings, eg the C examples quoted earlier, such 
thoughts/distinctions don&rsquo;t &lsquo;exist&rsquo;.
(which makes me wonder why code reviews have never queried the point, or 
registered that I might seem to be behaving inconsistently&hellip;)</p>

<p>Right. The SQLite developers did it that way in an effort to be
compatible with MySQL, and since have come to the realisation that that
was a mistake. In recent versions you can turn it off, in which cases
single quotes are for string literals and double quotes are for
identifiers (such as column names), as in standard SQL.

<p>Awwww. don&rsquo;t be like that - send it all to me, and I&rsquo;ll fix it for you 
(at exorbitant rates, of course)&hellip;</p>
<p>The above is valid - the editor has a file in one format/language, and 
is therefore applying &lsquo;the wrong rules&rsquo; when it attempts to make SQL 
look like Python!</p>
<p>The inconvenience (cf &ldquo;issue&rdquo;) that arises, is that many SQL debuggers 
and error-handlers (etc) will repeat-back the source-code/query 
as-provided. Consequently, those messages are all messed-up with 
extraneous tabs and new-lines, making them difficult to read and debug.

the query, and leave it to the &lsquo;importer&rsquo; of the query to figure out 
what is required?</p>

<p>Yes. Most &ldquo;connector&rdquo; software includes a feature which auto-magically 
escapes all variable-data - a valuable safety feature!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting by going further and providing app.devs with 
functions/methods, a mini-API if you will. Given that many?most don&rsquo;t 
like having to deal with SQL, the extra &lsquo;insulation&rsquo; boosts my personal 
popularity&hellip;
(and I need as much of that as I can get!)</p>

<p>Ok. I will have to give it some thought.</p>
<p>I generate most of my SQL dynamically, constructing the query 
programmatically using the meta-data in my system.</p>
<p>But now I am constructing some more complex queries, which I can&rsquo;t 
generate automatically yet. I am hoping that a pattern emerges which I 
can use to automate them, but for now I am doing it by hand.</p>
<p>There are a number of parameters required, and it will not be obvious at 
first sight what values are required. If I am going to keep the queries 
in a separate module, I think that I will have to provide some sort of 
accompanying documentation with each query explaining what the required 
parameters are.</p>
<p>Thinking aloud, I may set up a separate module for the queries, but make 
each one a &lsquo;function&rsquo;, which specifies what data is required. The caller 
calls the function with the data as an argument, and the function uses 
it to build the parameter list and returns the SQL along with the 
parameters. The function can also contain documentation explaining how 
the query works.</p>
<p>As you say, this has the benefit of separating the SQL from the Python 
code, so I will definitely pursue this idea.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>We have been talking (slightly OT for thread - apologies) about the 
narrow sub-objectives of transferring data between a Python application 
and an RDBMS. May I advise consideration of the wider specification?</p>
<p>For example, one may find it helpful to use a library/abstraction such 
as SQLAlchemy. Such facilitates transaction data being taken directly 
from/returned to a Python class! Whereas this discussion (above) only 
returns raw data-items, thus necessitating the application programmers 
coding an appropriate &lsquo;getter&rsquo; to provide data to the RDBMS 
interface-functions, and/or a &lsquo;setter&rsquo; to absorb query-results into the 
application&rsquo;s data-class(es)!</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of applications where one might eschew such 
advantages, eg a simple interface, and at the other end of the scale: if 
the data were to be formatted into a pandas data-frame.</p>
<p>Horses for courses!</p>
