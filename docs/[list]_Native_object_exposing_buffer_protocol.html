    <h1>Native object exposing buffer protocol</h1>
<p><a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2018-January/729896.html">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2018-January/729896.html</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to create a native Python object that exposes the buffer 
protocol.  Basically, something with a <code>._data member</code> which is a 
bytearray that I can still readinto, make directly into a numpy array, etc.</p>
<p>I can do it by inheriting the entire thing from bytearray directly, but 
that gives me a whole lot of methods that are unsuitable for what I&rsquo;m 
doing with it, which is reading the contents of a binary file, allowing 
them to be lightly malleable in memory, and then sending them on to a 
device.</p>
<p>Not the end of the world (the file&rsquo;s less than 2KB), but it seems like 
something that should be doable easily without having to throw around a 
lot of extraneous copies.</p>

<p>Could you use memoryviews instead of making the copies?</p>

<p>The “etc.” seems pretty important, there. You want the behaviour of
‘bytearray’ without actually inheriting that behaviour from the
‘bytearray’ type.</p>
<p>So, it seems your options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enumerate all the things, specifically, that you do want your new type
  to do. Don&rsquo;t hide anything in “etc.”, so that you know exactly what
  behaviours need to be implemented. Implement all those behaviours,
  without benefit of inheriting from <code>bytearray</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inherit from <code>bytearray</code>, but ameliorate the problems you want to
  avoid. This will require enumerating all those problems, so that you
  can know whether you have avoided them. Don&rsquo;t hide any of them in an
  “etc.”.</p>

<p>I look forward to your report from having tried it :-)</p>

<p>Well, one specific behavior.  Ideally, what I want is, when calls like 
RawIOBase.readinto and ndarray.frombuffer ask my class &ldquo;Hey, do you have 
any raw bytes that I can read and potentially write?&rdquo; it can answer &ldquo;Why 
certainly, here they are.&rdquo;  Something like a:</p>
<pre><code class="python">class Thingy:
   def __memoryview__(self):
     return memoryview(self._data)
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t look as if there&rsquo;s a dunder for that.  There&rsquo;s <strong>bytes</strong>, 
but that specifically requires you give back a bytes() object; even 
returning a bytearray causes an error.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; So, it seems your options are:
&gt; 
&gt; * Enumerate all the things, specifically, that you do want your new type
&gt;    to do. Don't hide anything in “etc.”, so that you know exactly what
&gt;    behaviours need to be implemented. Implement all those behaviours,
&gt;    without benefit of inheriting from ‘bytearray’.
&gt; 
&gt; * Inherit from ‘bytearray’, but ameliorate the problems you want to

&gt;    can know whether you have avoided them. Don't hide any of them in an
&gt;    “etc.”.
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s ultimately the way I&rsquo;m going about it, but since this is only 
going to get used in-house, I&rsquo;m approaching it the Pythonic way.  The 
problem is &ldquo;Most methods of bytearray make no sense on a data structure 
representing a fixed length waveform.&rdquo;  The solution is &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t use 
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curiosity having got the better of me I did some searching and found this &ldquo;Implementing the buffer protocol&rdquo; <a href="http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/buffer.html">http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/buffer.html</a>, any use to you?  Note that at the bottom of the link the final section &ldquo;References&rdquo; states &ldquo;The buffer interface used here is set out in PEP 3118, Revising the buffer protocol.&rdquo;, i.e. it is the new protocol and not the old Python 2 one.</p>
